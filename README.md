üñ•Ô∏è MCSA Infrastructure Project
A comprehensive team-based implementation of a Windows Server infrastructure, built using Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) principles. This project simulates a real-world IT environment for enterprise-level deployment and administration.

üìå Project Overview
This project focused on designing and deploying a robust Windows Server infrastructure. Key goals included implementing secure Active Directory services, managing users and policies, automating network configurations, and hosting internal web and FTP services.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Windows Server 2019

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

Group Policy Objects (GPO)

Organizational Units (OUs) & Delegation

Domain Name System (DNS)

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

Internet Information Services (IIS)

File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

NTFS Permissions

Disk Management & Storage Quotas

üß© Project Components
1Ô∏è‚É£ Active Directory & Group Policy
Configured Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

Created Organizational Units (OUs) by department (e.g., HR, IT, Finance).

Applied Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to manage user experience and enforce security.

Configured user login scripts, desktop settings, and password policies.

2Ô∏è‚É£ DNS & DHCP Configuration
Set up DNS zones and records for internal name resolution.

Configured DHCP scopes to automatically assign IP addresses.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Delegation & File Permissions
Delegated administrative control over specific OUs to department leads.

Implemented file sharing using NTFS and share-level permissions.

Enforced access control lists (ACLs) for secure file storage.

4Ô∏è‚É£ IIS & FTP Deployment
Installed and configured IIS for internal web hosting.

Deployed a company website with internal access.

Set up FTP Server with secure access for users to upload/download files.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Storage & Disk Management
Configured disk quotas per user to limit storage abuse.

Applied storage policies to manage data efficiently.

üßë‚Äçüíº How the Infrastructure Works
üîπ User Access & Security Policies
Users are added to the correct OU, and GPOs are applied based on department.

File and folder permissions ensure sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users.

üîπ Website & FTP Services
The IIS-hosted website is available internally to users for announcements and resources.

FTP access allows department-specific file exchange under secure authentication.


‚úÖ Key Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with enterprise-grade Windows Server features.

Gained skills in managing users, groups, permissions, and network services.

Practical understanding of delegation, security policies, and service hosting.
